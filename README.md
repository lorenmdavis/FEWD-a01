FEWD Assignment 1
## Hi, I'm Loren
I'm very excited to be a part of FEWD2. I work as graphic designer, but in my free time I like to:
* Knit 
* Try new restaurants
* Plan trips, I'm going to Hawaii for the first time this summer!
### Camping
I also love going camping with my Husband Mike. Here's a photo of us last October at [Doana Valley Campground](http://www.friendsofpalomarsp.org/). It was so cold!!
